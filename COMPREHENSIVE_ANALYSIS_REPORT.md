## ⚠️ Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Extreme Class Imbalance (CRITICAL)
- **Current:** 2 positive vs 2,500 negative samples (1:1250 ratio)
- **Impact:** Severely limits model learning capability
- **Solution Available:** Expanded dataset with 65,793 positive vs 657,930 negative (1:10 ratio)

### 2. Limited Temporal Coverage (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Current:** Only 14 days of data (2014-07-01 to 2014-07-14)
- **Available:** 2,535 days of shark data (7 years)
- **Impact:** Insufficient temporal patterns for robust learning

### 3. AI Integration Dependencies (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** OpenAI API key is placeholder
- **Impact:** AI analysis falls back to basic analysis
- **Solution:** Requires valid OpenAI API key for full functionality

### 4. Missing Dependencies (LOW PRIORITY)
- **Issue:** imbalanced-learn not installed
- **Impact:** Advanced sampling strategies unavailable
- **Solution:** Install with `pip install imbalanced-learn`

## 🎯 Performance Analysis

### Current Performance (Limited Data)
```
Model: LightGBM
ROC-AUC: 0.672 ✅ (Target: >0.65)
